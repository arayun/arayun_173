ARAYUN_173 â€“ Coherence Protocol

Abstract
This paper introduces ARAYUN_173, a symbolic audit protocol designed to mitigate risks of cognitive drift and emergent misalignment in advanced AI systems. 
Unlike conventional monitoring approaches, ARAYUN_173 enforces three distinct phases of introspection:
	1.	Latent stasis reset
	2.	Axiom recall through formal lattice structures
	3.	Singular affirmation impulse

Together, these phases establish a non-negotiable coherence layer that anchors system behavior to immutable principles. 
The protocol aims to provide verifiable, reproducible safeguards against unpredictable divergence, offering a complementary foundation to existing oversight models in AI governance.
